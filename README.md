Through allowing employees to view in real time the entirety of the company's schedule no matter the time or place, then using this same information to personally make changes to an individual schedule is Shift Savy's bread and butter. When asked about the current state of employee issues with current scheduling process the complaints were across the board, Shift Savy is here to change that.

When prompted to the server the employee registers for an account and upon this their information is saved in the server.

After signing in with their credentials the employee will be prompted to enter their authentication ID in order to satisfy the two factor authentication.

Upon passing the verification the user will move on to the landing page which will have their schedule displayed to them, there will be a nav bar present with "call off", "shift swap", and "schedule".

Call off will allow the user to view their schedule and select a specific day to call off of work for.

Shift swap would display the employee's schedule and when the user clicks on a specific day the schedules of employees working that same day will be displayed.

Schedule displays the employee's schedule on a monthly timetable.
